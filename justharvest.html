				I worked on this project through Service Design, an elective class in the HCI program. In this class, we learned to define and study services and data-driven product service systems and the basics of envisioning and designing them. The class culminated in a final client project. We partnered with <a href="https://www.justharvest.org/">Just Harvest</a>, a local nonprofit that works to fight hunger in Allegheny County through advocacy, education, and community outreach.</p>
				<p>
				As a class, we were tasked with understanding the current social, economic, and technological factors surrounding access to government programs. Each team took a unique stance on developing new services, apps, and platforms that leverage Just Harvest’s expertise in reducing food insecurity.

		  	<div class="panel">
		  		<p>
		  		Just Harvest is limited by their resources and the strict government guidelines they must work within. They need a service solution that leverages the community without creating more work for them. A solution we offered was to host reocurring commnunity potlucks, led by resident leaders within their own neighborhoods and facilitated and attended by Just Harvest staff. These community-embedded meals allow support networks to grow where they are needed most. Food insecure individuals can find support and solace and Just Harvest gains insight into community needs.	
		  		</p>
		  		<p>
		  		This project was broken into a research phase, an ideation phase, and a prototyping phase.

		  	<div class="panel">
		  		<p>
		  		Stakeholder interviews and contextual inquiry helped us gain insight into the current Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) users and their experiences:
		  		</p>
		  		<li>Food insecurity is defined by a lack of physical and monetary access to nutritious food.</li>
		  		<li>In Allegheny county, food insecurity disproportionately affects low-income communities of color. These individuals often suffer from obesity and diabetes.</li>
		  		<li>Relief seekers have two main options: they can enroll in SNAP, and they can utilize community resources like food banks. Just Harvest can provide assistance navigating these resources.</li>
		  		<p>Here's where things gets tricky:</p>
		  		<li>SNAP qualification guidelines are strict. A rigid formula determines eligibility for government benefits, so slight income variations constantly push people in and out of eligibility.
		  		</li>
		  		<li>SNAP users have limited access to technology. A large percentage of applicants don’t have regular access to phones.</li>
		  		<p>
		  		Based on these findings, we decided to focus on supporting those low-income individuals who don’t qualify for SNAP but still need help accessing adequate nutrition and food. We also brought our attention towards community partnerships. There is a distinction between government responsibilities and Just Harvest capabilities. Based in Allegheny County, Just Harvest has the greatest reach within the community.

		  		Our ideation centered around storyboarding and speed dating those storyboards with Just Harvest staff. This is one example. View the rest of the storyboards <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vDT-bOKurMmTtGp2Aeml4jz08RB47yaD_vlvKuGoNAI/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a>

		  	<div class="inner-text">
		  		We took the feedback we received from Just Harvest staff and plotted our ideas based on their potential impact and ease of implementation. The goal was to sit in the top-right quadrant. Clearly, nothing came close - so we went back to the drawing board. We came up with the community potluck idea during another brainstorming session.
