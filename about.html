            Hi there! If you want to know a little bit more about me, you’ve come to the right place. I'm originally from Mountain View, California, but I went to Carnegie Mellon in search of some East Coast experience. Little did I know, Pittsburgh is closer to Ohio than New York - but it's all good, the city has grown on me.
            <p>
            My first exposure to anything remotely related to UI/UX was during my senior year in high school at <a href="http://www.freestyleacademy.rocks/">Freestyle Academy</a>, where I took Web Design and Graphic Design. I learned that I liked making pretty websites, and found a creative outlet that wasn't writing (my other passion in high school).
            </p>
           <p>
            When I came to CMU, I was planning on majoring in IS and minoring in Design, but I found that HCI was a more encompassing program for what I wanted to do, so I applied and got in to the minor my sophomore year.
            </p>
           <p>
            For a long time, I thought I wanted to be a software engineer. It seemed like all the cool kids were doing it, and I liked coding. But by the beginning of my junior year, with an engineering internship and several CS classes under my belt, I realized that I didn't want to stare at a computer screen for 40 hours a week for the rest of my life. Throughout my junior year, I found the work I did in my HCI classes much more engaging and fun, so I decided to make the pivot to UX.
            </p>
            <p>
            So what have I learned in my (almost) 21 years on this planet? Embrace change. Failure is a step on the path to success. Sometimes things happen for a reason, and sometimes they don't. It's how you bounce back that matters.
