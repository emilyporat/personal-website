          <h2>What I Do</h2>
          <p class="p-XL">
            I do a little bit of everything, but I am most drawn towards the synthesis & organizational elements of UX. I like making sense of things. I like spreadsheets. My fridge is color-coded (jk, but you get the picture).
          </p>

          <div  class="space"></div>

          <p>In practice, this applies to a couple different areas. First, I love translating raw data into actionable insights and solutions, and I can do that best when I'm most involved in the early research stages and initial design + strategy stages of a project. I also enjoy the other end of the spectrum - working with design systems and organizing component libraries. I've found that my type-A tendencies tend to complement my more right-brained colleagues in these areas.</p>

          <div  class="space"></div>

<!--           <p>During my time at Deloitte, I've supported and led 20+ projects, ranging from 4-week usability evaluations to 9-month digital transformations. I also founded and led a grassroots community for junior designers and contributed to several initiatives focused on the new-hire experience.</p>

        <div  class="space"></div>

        <div class="small-highlight"><h3>Think beyond pixels</h3>
          <p>I'm not <em>just</em> a pixel-pusher, professional rectangle-drawer, or a <a target="_blank" href="https://designtitles.com/">Sophisticated Executive of Shapes</a>. I care about nailing down the "why" before the "how," and I'm not afraid to stand up for what I believe in.</p>
        </div>

        <div  class="space"></div>

        <div class="small-highlight"><h3>Stay humble & keep learning</h3>
          <p>My formal education at Carnegie Mellon was in Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction, but I didn't stop learning when I graduated. Reading books like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ruinedby.design/">Ruined by Design</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nointerface.com/book/">The Best Interface is No Interface</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/qualitative-research-evaluation-methods/book232962">Qualitative Research and Evaluation</a> (just to name a few) have helped me fill in the gaps and transition my career from case study to reality. They've influenced me to question my assumptions, ask 'why' more, and practice my craft with rigor.</p>
        </div>

        <div  class="space"></div>

        <div class="small-highlight"><h3>Own your career</h3>
          <p>I don't wait around for the things I want — I got after them proactively. For example, when I noticed a major gap in Deloitte's new-hire experience, I took initiative to create a mentorship program for aspiring designers.</p>
        </div>

        <div  class="space"></div>

        <div class="small-highlight"><h3>Teamwork makes the dream work</h3>
          <p>Design is a team sport, and part of working smart, not hard, is being able to effectively delegate. I know when to step up and take charge, but I also strive to give others opportunities to make an impact.</p>
        </div>


 <!--        <div class="so-what">
          <h4>What we didn't do</h4>
          <p>The team was able to do some family & friends recruiting for usability testing as we built out the 2.0 designs, but we didn't talk to a wide range of target users due to limited capacity and ability to reach that group.</p>
        </div>  -->

<!--         <div id="about" class="body right">


            <div class="space"></div>
            
            <h3>Values</h3>
            <p>Pragmatism wins. There's a spectrum of possibility and never enough time, resources, or budget to get everything 100% right. As designers, we have a responsibility to understand the user's needs and do all we can to give voice to those needs while balancing the constraints of the real world.</p>  
            <p>Design is a team sport. An integral part of any project is working with functional and technical teammates to assess level of effort, technical complexity, and overall feasibility of the designs. Because, at the end of the day, a pixel-perfect design is nothing without stakeholder buy-in and working code.</p>
            <p>Wield power wisely. Every design decision I make - from who to interview during research to the button color on a UI - impacts the end user. It’s my responsibility to honor the perspectives of marginalized groups, check my biases at the door, and generally design in ways that are respectful, ethical and useful.</p>

            <div class="space"></div>
            
            <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>I'm originally from Mountain View, California, where I grew up beliving it was normal for houses to cost $2M and for Google to be in your backyard (spoiler alert, it's not!). My first exposure to anything remotely related to UI/UX was during my senior year in high school at <a href="http://www.freestyleacademy.rocks/">Freestyle Academy</a>, where I took Web Production and Graphic Design. I learned that I liked making pretty websites, and found a creative outlet that wasn't journalism (my other passion in high school).</p>
              <p>After high school, I decided to leave sunny CA and move across the country to Pittsburgh, PA to attend Carnegie Mellon University. During my first two years at CMU, I wanted to be a software engineer. It seemed like all the cool kids were doing it, and I liked coding. But by the beginning of my junior year, with an engineering internship and several CS classes under my belt, I realized that I 1) wasn't that great at coding and 2) cared significantly more about *why* digital products work for users than *how* they work in the backend. Throughout my junior year, I found my HCI classes much more engaging and fun, so I decided to shift my focus towards UX.</p>
              <p>These days, in my free time, I like to lift weights, bake sourdough bread, and hang out with my two cats.</p>
