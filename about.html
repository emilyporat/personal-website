          <p class="p-XL">
            I live in Washington DC and work at Deloitte Digital, primarily with federal government clients.

          <div class="short-divider"></div>
          <p> 
            I take pride in the mission-oriented work my job affords me: a lot of our projects center around improving technology systems for aid programs. My work has supported those seeking food secruity, affordable housing, emergency management, and more. 
          </p>
          <p>
            So far, during my time at Deloitte, I've supported and led half a dozen projects, ranging from 4-week usability evaluations to 9-month digital transformations. I also founded and led a grassroots community for junior designers and contributed to several initiatives focused on the new-hire experience.

            <h3>Skills + Strengths</h3>
            <p>I do a little bit of everything, but I am most drawn towards the synthesis & organizational elements of UX. I like making sense of things. I like spreadsheets. My fridge is color-coded (jk, but you get the picture). In practice, this applies to a couple different areas. First, I love translating raw data into actionable insights and solutions, and I can do that best when I'm most involved in the early research stages and initial design + strategy stages of a project. I also enjoy the other end of the spectrum - working with design systems and organizing component libraries. I've found that my type-A tendencies tend to complement my more right-brained colleagues in these areas.</p>

            <div class="space"></div>
            
            <h3>Values</h3>
            <p>Pragmatism wins. There's a spectrum of possibility and never enough time, resources, or budget to get everything 100% right. As designers, we have a responsibility to understand the user's needs and do all we can to give voice to those needs while balancing the constraints of the real world.</p>  
            <p>Design is a team sport. An integral part of any project is working with functional and technical teammates to assess level of effort, technical complexity, and overall feasibility of the designs. Because, at the end of the day, a pixel-perfect design is nothing without stakeholder buy-in and working code.</p>
            <p>Wield power wisely. Every design decision I make - from who to interview during research to the button color on a UI - impacts the end user. Itâ€™s my responsibility to honor the perspectives of marginalized groups, check my biases at the door, and generally design in ways that are respectful, ethical and useful.</p>

            <div class="space"></div>
            
            <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>I'm originally from Mountain View, California, where I grew up beliving it was normal for houses to cost $2M and for Google to be in your backyard (spoiler alert, it's not!). My first exposure to anything remotely related to UI/UX was during my senior year in high school at <a href="http://www.freestyleacademy.rocks/">Freestyle Academy</a>, where I took Web Production and Graphic Design. I learned that I liked making pretty websites, and found a creative outlet that wasn't journalism (my other passion in high school).</p>
              <p>After high school, I decided to leave sunny CA and move across the country to Pittsburgh, PA to attend Carnegie Mellon University. During my first two years at CMU, I wanted to be a software engineer. It seemed like all the cool kids were doing it, and I liked coding. But by the beginning of my junior year, with an engineering internship and several CS classes under my belt, I realized that I 1) wasn't that great at coding and 2) cared significantly more about *why* digital products work for users than *how* they work in the backend. Throughout my junior year, I found my HCI classes much more engaging and fun, so I decided to shift my focus towards UX.</p>
              <p>These days, in my free time, I like to lift weights, bake sourdough bread, and hang out with my two cats.</p>
