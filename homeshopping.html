				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p> Orchard is a real estate startup that offers streamlined services and tooling for consumers looking to buy and/or sell their home. Orchard employs its own real estate agents, internally called “Home Advisors,” who support customers throughout their home shopping & buying experience.
				</p>

				<div class="space"></div>

				<h3>Why invest in Home Shopping tooling?</h3>
				<p>
					
					<ul>
							<li>Home Advisors play an integral role in <em>customer acquisition</em> because they are responsible for helping our customers find and close on their new homes. It’s important that they have access to great tooling to support them in managing a large pipeline of customers and in delivering a best-in-class customer experience.</li>
							<li>HAs are one of our <em>largest and most expensive teams</em>, so there is a lot of value in driving efficiency for them. Currently, HAs are managing the home shopping process across a number of different systems, so consolidating that work into a single tool will help drive efficiency.</li>
							<li>Before this project, HAs were using <em>Salesforce</em> to manage their home shoppers. Transitioning them out of Salesforce and into Deal Hub, our homegrown internal platform, will save us thousands on <em>licensing costs.</em></li>
					</ul>

				<h2>The project</h2>

				<h3>Primary users</h3>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Home Advisors (HAs) are licensed real estate agents who work on the “buy side” of a transaction. Unlike a traditional agent, Orchard HAs have a large pipeline of customers and may be working with 10-20 customers at a time. </li>
						<li>HAs spend 20-30% time out in the field meeting with customers for home tours and closings and the rest of their time writing contracts, checking in with customers, and other misc. admin tasks.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<div class="space"></div>

				<h3>Research + defining scope</h3>
				<p>My PM and I kicked off this project by building an understanding of the current state of Deal Hub with current users to understand existing functionality and usability gaps.</p>
				<p>To ensure we were building the right product and gain buy-in with HAs, we decided to run a 2-month beta program with 3 high-performing HAs and 1 of their managers to ensure a smooth transition. Throughout the program, we:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Ran card-sorting exercises with HAs to understand what information HAs need and want during the home shopping phase.</li>
						<li>Concept-tested an initial design based on the high-level functionality requirements.</li>
						<li>Beta group participants fully adopted DH and provided feedback on a weekly basis while eng finished out the next set of MVP+ features.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

					</div>
				</div>

				<h3>Project scope + requirements</h3>
				<p>I worked closely with my PM and our Brokerage team lead to determine the high-level requirements for this project while factoring in the user needs and pain points we'd uncovered. At a high level, HAs would be moving from using primarily Salesforce to Deal Hub, where we would need to support:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Managing a pipeline of all home shoppers</li>
						<li>Viewing an activity feed of customer <> Orchard communications</li>
						<li>Updating information about customer engagement and motivations (e.g. reason for moving)</li>
						<li>Accessing customer’s saved homes & searches (via the Orchard customer dashboard)</li>
						<li>Viewing home tour feedback and upcoming tours</li>
						<li>Easily creating and checking off tasks</li>
					</ul>
				<p>Most of this work was building net-new functionality, but my PM and I also took the time to make strategic usability improvements to existing features. See an overview below:</p>

				<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<p>
					The new dashboard + related work was rolled out smoothly & on-time. We ran a survey to understand HA satisfaction a few weeks after release, and found that most HAs feel that Deal Hub has made doing their jobs easier.
					<ul>
						<li>Overall tooling satisfaction took a small dip  (-5%) - likely due to the transition in general and having to learn a new tool.</li>
						<li>Satisfaction with pipeline management, tasking, and communication remained flat. </li>
						<li>Satisfaction with managing new home closings increased (+26%).</li>
						<li>When asked if Deal Hub has made doing their jobs easier, 57% said yes, 29% were neutral, and 14% disagreed.</li>
					</ul>
