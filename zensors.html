				<div class="context-title">Context</div>
				<p>“Smart” appliances with built-in cameras, such as the NestCam and Amazon Echo Show, are becoming more pervasive. They hold the promise of bringing high fidelity, contextually rich sensing into our homes, workplaces and neighborhoods. Despite recent and impressive advances, computer vision sys-tems are still limited in the types of questions they can answer, and more importantly, do not immediately generalize acrossdiverse human environments. </p>
				<p>In response, researchers have investigated hybrid crowd and AI-powered methods that collect human labels to bootstrap automatic processes. However,deployments have been small and mostly confined to institutional settings, leaving open questions about scalability and generality of the approach.</p>
				<p>The current system relies on a crowdworker interface (similar to Mechanical Turk) for labeling images. The existing interface has several issues. First, there is no way to communicate what is wrong with an image or question when the crowdworker has low confidence. Second, the user gets very little feedback. Third, users are shown an entire uncropped (often low-quality) region of an image. </p>
				<p>
				In redesigning this interface, I wanted to address these issues and create a labeling interface that is simple to use, but also improves accuracy and speed of answering.</p>

      <div class="panel">
          <p>Given existing research, I created a few potential users of the platform.</p>
            <div class="caption-large"> 
              <b>Jay</b> is a crowdworker who spends 8-10 hours a day looking at a computer screen. He has been working on Zensors labeling work for one week, and has had a fairly smooth experience, but often gets bored after hours on doing the same task, and notices that his mind regularly drifts by the end of the day. Jay only gets feedback from his manager when his performance is lagging, and does not have a great sense of how he is doing compared to the other workers. Additionally, Jay regularly labels images with low confidence if he is even somewhat unsure of the correct answer. Jay puts a moderate amount of effort in to his work because he knows that he is easily replaceable, but he does not have a lot of passion for this job, nor a sense of the impact he is making.
            </div>

            <div class="caption-large"> 
            <b>Kelly</b> is a manager of about 20 crowdworkers; she oversees their progress and acts as quality assurance, ensuring that the workers are labeling accurately and efficiently. Kelly has access to data about each worker’s performance, but she must dig through a lot of extraneous information to get a sense of how individuals are doing. Kelly usually warns individuals whose performance is lagging, but rarely rewards those who are doing well, mostly because her priority is to ensure that no one is dragging down the group. She is primarily concerned with accuracy and efficiency, and wants to ensure that all the images and questions are fair. Kelly wants to motivate her employees to do the best job possible, but does not know the best way to do this.
            </div>
      </div>

      <div class="process-title">Scenarios</div>
      <div class="panel">
        <div class="caption-large">
        <b>Jay</b> wants to feel confident about the labels he submits, but after three ambiguous images, he is starting to doubt his own perception. He does not want to be penalized for submitting incorrect labels, but feels embarrassment for being unable to label so many images. The new labeling interface will provide workers example answers and mark ambiguous images with comments so workers feel confident in their responses.
        <p>
        <b>Jay</b> dreads coming to work because of the boredom and lack of energy he will undoubtedly face. The new labeling interface will gamify the system to provide a more engaging experience as well as a sense of relative worker performance. It will also enhance intrinsic motivation by increasing employee recognition and showing workers the impact they make.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Kelly</b> is tired of resolving issues surrounding poor images and unclear questions. She is frustrated that she has to manually check responses for patterns and identify unclear images on her own. The new management system will offer her at-a-glance statistics for questions and flag those that workers have noted as poor. She will also receive daily and weekly digests of trends so she does not have to seek out issues.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Kelly</b> has noticed a lack of motivation among employees, but is unsure of how to make her employees more engaged. The new management system will easily allow her to recognize outstanding performers, set goals, and send out announcements so that the workers will feel more recognized and connected and take pride in their work.

          Designing the interface was a multi-step, iterative process that started with a whiteboarding session. I worked with Sean, and we spent 10 minutes ideating separately before we shared what we came up with. We used this session to think through the purpose of the platform as well, and were able to narrow the scope and heirarchy of information.
