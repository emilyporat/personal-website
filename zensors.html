				<div class="context-title">Context</div>
				<a href="https://www.zensors.com/">Zensors</a> is a startup that was born from a CMU HCI research project. I joined the team during my Junior spring as a UX Designer and Frontend Engineer.</p>
        <p>
        Zensors is a sensing platform that extracts data from existing camera feeds to help businesses and offices gain insight into what's going on in the spaces they own. It utilizes crowdsourcing and AI to answer questions about images. 
        <p>When I came on board, the existing crowdsourcing interface had several issues surrounding lack of feedback and accuracy.
				My role was to help redesign and re-build the crowd UI. In redesigning this interface, I wanted to address the aforementioned issues by creating a labeling interface that is simple to use, but also improves accuracy and speed of answering.</p>

              <b>Jay</b> is a crowdworker who spends 8-10 hours a day looking at a computer screen. He has been working on Zensors labeling work for one week, and has had a fairly smooth experience, but often gets bored after hours on doing the same task, and notices that his mind regularly drifts by the end of the day. Jay only gets feedback from his manager when his performance is lagging, and does not have a great sense of how he is doing compared to the other workers. Additionally, Jay regularly labels images with low confidence if he is even somewhat unsure of the correct answer. Jay puts a moderate amount of effort in to his work because he knows that he is easily replaceable, but he does not have a lot of passion for this job, nor a sense of the impact he is making.
            </div>

            <div class="caption-large"> 
            <b>Kelly</b> is a manager of about 20 crowdworkers; she oversees their progress and acts as quality assurance, ensuring that the workers are labeling accurately and efficiently. Kelly has access to data about each worker’s performance, but she must dig through a lot of extraneous information to get a sense of how individuals are doing. Kelly usually warns individuals whose performance is lagging, but rarely rewards those who are doing well, mostly because her priority is to ensure that no one is dragging down the group. She is primarily concerned with accuracy and efficiency, and wants to ensure that all the images and questions are fair. Kelly wants to motivate her employees to do the best job possible, but does not know the best way to do this.

      <div class="process-title">Scenarios</div>

        <div class="caption-large">
        <b>Jay</b> wants to feel confident about the labels he submits, but after three ambiguous images, he is starting to doubt his own perception. He does not want to be penalized for submitting incorrect labels, but feels embarrassment for being unable to label so many images. The new labeling interface will provide workers example answers and mark ambiguous images with comments so workers feel confident in their responses.
        <p>
        <b>Jay</b> dreads coming to work because of the boredom and lack of energy he will undoubtedly face. The new labeling interface will gamify the system to provide a more engaging experience as well as a sense of relative worker performance. It will also enhance intrinsic motivation by increasing employee recognition and showing workers the impact they make.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Kelly</b> is tired of resolving issues surrounding poor images and unclear questions. She is frustrated that she has to manually check responses for patterns and identify unclear images on her own. The new management system will offer her at-a-glance statistics for questions and flag those that workers have noted as poor. She will also receive daily and weekly digests of trends so she does not have to seek out issues.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Kelly</b> has noticed a lack of motivation among employees, but is unsure of how to make her employees more engaged. The new management system will easily allow her to recognize outstanding performers, set goals, and send out announcements so that the workers will feel more recognized and connected and take pride in their work.

        This screen shows how we might display a Yes/No question to a crowdworker. Some key elements are the instructions and examples - these provide context to users and helps them be more sure of their answers. There is also a bar at the top containing statistics about the user's performance - ideally encouraging them to work faster.

        This screen is how I imagined managers of crowdworkers could view the labels at a large scale. Each sensor has actions associated with it, such as reporting a picture/question as bad quality. Managers can also see the specific feedback crowdworkers gave and utilize it to target the issues.

          I spent a large chunk of my time building out these basic designs with React. I learned React for this project, so getting up to speed with the framework took some time. Once I created the basic answering page, I created skeleton pages for other basic but necessary user actions, like logging in, creating new devices and sensors, etc. At the end of the semester, I revisted these wireframes, built out mid-fi prototypes in Adobe XD, and did some usability testing. We ended up adding a tutorial section at the beginning - the first 10 questions a user answers gives them feedback on whether or not they got it right. I also increased the size of the buttons to make quick answering as easy as possible.

            These screens show a Yes/No question, followed by the screen pops up when a user selects 'low confidence'. The user is required to give feedback so a manager can understand <i>why</i> the user is having trouble answering. The last page is one idea I had for answering count questions - a slider. The bounds would be calculated by taking the 3 standard deviations of the average response.

            This second iteration has the same general flow as the first set, but I changed three major things.
            <p>First, the back button is smaller and in the top bar. This is to discourage people from going back. They can if they need to, but having a back button that was as large as the next button communicated that the actions were of equal weight.</p>
            <p>Second, instead of a '?' icon at the bottom of the page, I placed example answers at the bottom. I later changed this, as I'll explain in the next section.</p>
            <p>Third, we settled on a click-to-count mechanism. This is better than an input box or slider for two reasons: it is known to increase accuracy because users have to be engaged, and it essentially creates a heatmap of answers that can be used for other data analysis.</p>
            <p>After this round of designs, I did some casual usability testing around the HCI lab, and found a big problem: people thought that clicking on the example number was equivalent to submitting the answer. After discussing this with a teammate, we came to the conclusion that the visual looked too much like a timeline, and its purpose was generally confusing.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="pics/zensors/crowd3.jpg" class="med-pic">
        <div class="inner-text">
            For the third and final iteration, I focused on making the interface as dead simple to use as possible. The team decided to put examples on hold for the time being, so the UI was super basic: picture, question, answer, with large text and large buttons.
            <p>
            As mentioned before, we also integrated a preliminary tutorial section, where the first 10 questions would display the answer afterwards so users could get some feedback as they went.

          After finalizing the prototypes, I revisted the existing UI and implemented the visual and functional changes. One of the most difficult tasks was dealing with resizing the images and their masks - because images were coming in from different video feeds, their dimensions ranged. To account for that, I had to do some simple math to resize each image. The math wasn't the tricky part - updating the state of a child component when a button was clicked in the parent component was the tricky part.
          <p>
          One of the more fun tasks was writing the code that dynamically placed and deleted the count dots on images. I stored the dots and their relative positions (to the top left corner of the image) in an array, and simple added to the list on click or found and removed the item from the list on click if that click was within some small margin of an existing dot.
