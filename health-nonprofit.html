			<h2>Project Overview</h2>

			<p class="p-XL">
				The organization was struggling to reach a large segment of their target audience: individuals living with a particular neurological disorder. The client's website has a wealth of information, but users can't find what they need and tend to abandon the site quickly.
			</p>
			
			<div class="space"></div>
			
			<h3>Approach</h3>
			<p>
				Our team evaluated the client's digital footprint from a UX, content, and data perspective with the goals of 1) understanding why users can't find what they need and 2) providing strategic recommendations to improve the overarching user experience.
			</p>
			
			<div class="space"></div>

			<h3>Outcome</h3>
			<p>
				We delivered a comprehensive report that included all our stakeholder and user research findings, synthesis artifacts (Modes & Mindsets and Journey Maps) and outputs from collaborative Product Visioning + Roadmapping sessions.

		<h2 class="body right">Process</h2>
			<div class="body right">
				<p class="p-XL">We had 12 weeks and a client with a large appetite for interviews. I owned the following activities:</p>
				
				<div  class="space"></div>

				<div class="small-highlight" style="border-color: var(--purple)"><h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
<!-- 				<p>Usability analysis of key pages on the client's website.</p> -->
				<p><b style="font-family: 'Barlow Medium'">Goal:</b> Pinpoint severe usability issues and familiarize myself with the site.</p></div>

				<div  class="space"></div>

				<div class="small-highlight" style="border-color: var(--purple)"><h3>Interviews</h3>
				<p>Guided conversations with 17 members of internal leadership, 11 external partners, and 16 end users.</p>
				<p><b style="font-family: 'Barlow Medium'">Goal:</b> For stakeholders, understand organizational goals, priorities, and challenges. For users, understand their lived experiences, needs, barriers to accessing information.</p></div>

				<div  class="space"></div>

				<div class="small-highlight" style="border-color: var(--purple)"><h3>Usability Testing</h3>
<!-- 				<p>Collect qualitative and quantitatve data on user behavior and approach to using the website.</p> -->
				<p><b style="font-family: 'Barlow Medium'">Goal:</b> Uncover key usability issues - confirm or deny heuristic findings. Prioritize focus areas for redesign.</p></div>

				<div  class="space"></div>

				<div class="small-highlight" style="border-color: var(--purple)"><h3>Synthesis</h3>
<!-- 				<p>Affinity diagramming to pull out key themes.</p> -->
				<p><b style="font-family: 'Barlow Medium'">Goal:</b> Build a robust understanding of stakeholder and user viewpoints.</p></div>

				<div  class="space"></div>

				<div class="small-highlight" style="border-color: var(--purple)"><h3>Modest & Mindsets + Journey Maps</h3>
<!-- 				<p>Approach + experience driven models.</p> -->
				<p><b style="font-family: 'Barlow Medium'">Goal:</b> Help us understand user needs and prioritize features.</p></div>

				<div  class="space"></div>

            <div class="so-what">
        		<h4>Why these methods?</h4>
        		<p>While it would've been nice to do a diary study to understand more organic usage of the site or true ethnographic field research, we were on a tight timeline and in the midst of a global pandemic. Zoom-based interviews and usability testing got us 80% of the way there in terms of understanding user needs.</p>

				<p class="p-XL">These were are overarching takeaways from all our research activities:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Usability issues stem from organizational issues</li>
					<li>Information overload hinders understandability and findability</li>
					<li>To engage, users need to trust the organization</li>
					<li>There is no “one size fits all” solution for improving reach and engagement</li>

				<h3>1. Usability issues stem from organizational issues</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>As the organization has grown, its website has not effectively scaled with it.</li> 
					<li>Siloed systems and unclear strategy have prevented departments from forming effective content and data governance processes.</li>
					<li>This trickles down into every aspect of the end-user web experience, from information overload to the lack of engagement and personalization strategy.</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="mid-panel-text">
				<h3>2. Information overload hinders understandability and findability</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The Information Architecture, navigation components, and Calls to Action are visually confusing and do not match user expectations.</li> 
					<li>There are many inaccessible components across the site (inadequate color contrast or missing labels).</li> 
					<li>Combined with the vast amount of information, the confusing structural organization of the site hinders users’ ability to find what they need efficiently.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>3. To engage, users need to trust the organization</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Many end users experience feeling isolated, overwhelmed, and frustrated during their diagnosis process.</li> 
					<li>Most users want to learn about the basics of this health topic, treatment options, and first aid from a science-backed, up-to-date, reliable source.</li>
					<li>Users who are unfamiliar with the org need to build trust in the organization before committing to getting involved with their time, money, or other resources.</li>

			<div class="mid-panel-text">
				<h3>4. There is no “one size fits all” solution for improving reach and engagement</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Getting diagnosed with and treating with this condition is highly personal, variable, and based on one’s access to specialized healthcare, background, trust in doctors, etc.</li> 
					<li>It’s important to acknowledge the inherent health disparities that come with privilege (or lack thereof) – those who need the organization the most may never get engaged due to access barriers and lack of awareness.</li> 
					<li>That's why it was so important to go past demographic-based Personas and delve into highly granular Mindsets, based off characteristic and attributes.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<img class="pic-left" src="pics/Nonprofit/diversity.png">
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="panel" id="Component Audit">
		<h2 class="body right">Our Recommendations</h2>
			<div class="body right">
				<p class="p-XL">To enable the client to employ nuanced personalization strategies, I created nuanced models - Modes, Mindsets, and Journeys - that provide insight on the characteristics, behaviors, priorities <i>beyond</i> demographics.</p>

				<div class="space"></div>

				<h3>Modes</h3>
				<p>Behaviors or tasks. Modes outline what people do throughout their journey with their condition.</p>

				<div class="space"></div>

				<h3>Mindsets</h3>
				<p>Characteristics or attributes. Mindsets help us understand how people experience their journey with their condition.</p>

				<div class="space"></div>

				<h3>Journeys</h3>
				<p>The experience of a mindset within various modes. By overlaying a mindset onto a mode, or several modes, we can identify the user’s perspective and needs in a journey.</p>

				<div class="space"></div>

				<div class="so-what">
					<h4>Why Modes & Mindsets Over Personas?</h4>
					<p>The community that this client is trying to reach is diverse in diagnosis, background, and experience. Creating <i>Patient</i>, <i>Caregiver</i>, and <i>Supporter</i> personas would be reductive, and most importantly, unhelpful for making design decisions.</p>
				</div>

				<p>I created 9 Mindsets and 11 Modes. To narrow in on priorities, we had the client select their top 3 mindsets that they <i>must</i> serve with their website. I created corresponding journeys for those 3 mindsets. See an example below.</p>
			</div>
	</div>

	<div class="full-width-mid-page">
		<div class="panel dark" style="text-align: left;">
			<div class="mid-panel-text">
				<h3>Motivated Caregiver Journey</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The “Motivated Caregiver” mindset is responsible for the care and safety of a child with this disorder. This user is highly motivated to find information online but is not connected with the larger community.</li> 
					<li>The client identified this Mindset as their #1 priority to reach on their website.</li>
					<li>Contextualizing individual behavior and feelings helped us recommend more tailored opportunities to improve the website, such as positioning itself as a reputable content source <i>before</i> asking users to engage with the community or donate.</li>
					<li>These opportunities ultimately served as inputs to our Product Roadmap session with the client.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<img class="pic-left" src="pics/Nonprofit/journey.png">
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="panel" id="Component Audit">
		<h2 class="body right">Design Principles</h2>
			<div class="body right">
				<p class="p-XL">Along with identifying specific features and improvement opportunities, I developed a list of design principles for the client to employ during any future redesign effort:</p>

				<div class="space"></div>

				<h3>Accessible</h3>
				<p>The website will provide content that is universally easy to understand and find and features that are easy to use, regardless of user ability or background.</p>

				<div class="space"></div>

				<h3>Personalized</h3>
				<p>The website will leverage the research we have done on user journeys as the organization works on leveraging behavioral data to feed personalized content to users throughout their journey.</p>

				<div class="space"></div>

				<h3>Person (with condition)-Centric</h3>
				<p>The website will center around the experience of people with the condition. It aims to support and connect them and their caregivers before any other group.</p>

				<div class="space"></div>

				<h3>Trustworthy</h3>
				<p>The website will instill trust in its users by presenting fact-based, accurate, updated information and clearly communicating their mission and brand.</p>


				<div class="so-what">
					<h4>So what?</h4>
					<p>These principles are simple and intuitive. They cleanly summarize everything we learned about user needs, and the client can use them as guideposts for future decision making.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
	</div>

	<div class="panel" id="Outcome">
		<h2 class="body right">Outcome</h2>
		<div class="body right">
            <p class="p-XL">The synthesis models, design principles, and the org's new and improved product vision + prioritized backlog we delivered will help the client turn our research into action.</p>

            <div class="space"></div>

            <h4>Takeaways</h4>
            <ul>
            	<li>On a personal note, this was my first time identifying that my team was under-staffed (I was drowning trying to prep, lead, and transcribe notes for ~50 interviews), requesting (and receiving!) support, and ultimately managing someone junior to me.</li> 
            	<li>I had to figure out how to let go some of my control and trust my mentee to deliver. I had to figure out how to effectively delegate and help us both grow -- like overcoming the desire to re-do work myself rather than provide feedback.</li>
            </ul>
