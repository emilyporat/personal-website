			This was a project I worked on through Social Web, an elective HCI class that examines a sampling of the social, technical and business challenges social web sites must solve to be successful. 
			<p>Through this project, my team aimed to gain a deeper understanding of why and how people use Instagram, how authenticity plays into social media, and how best to design a social media platform so that users feel like they are posting authentically.</p>
			<p>The problem we identified is as follows: Instagram is intended to connect individuals, but more often that not, it is used to curate highly edited, illusory versions of themselves. People are not at fault for this. Rather, the platforms that enable and even promote this behavior are to blame.</p>
			<p>
			We specifically focused on redesigning Instagram to promote an authentic user experience. By doing so, we hope to create more open spaces, conducive to deeper connections, and more meaningful presentations of one’s self.

		<div class="process-title">Research</div>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>To better understand the psychology behind decision making on Instagram, and the influence of social media platforms as a context for user behavior, we read five research papers on these topics. The questions we were looking to answer were 'What are some problematic aspects of Instagram and social media?' and 'What is the psychology behind trends in social media consumption?'
		  </p>
		  <p>
			These were the final takeaways from the literature:
			<li>Users show their desire to know themselves better through curation of self-image online, and wish for others to see them as they see themselves</li>
			<li>Narcissism is directly linked with the desire for a large social network </li>
			<li>Peer comparison is fueled by the use of numbers that represent social currency</li>
			<li>Users adjust “performances of the self” to fit the context of community-wide conversation</li>
		  </p>
		</div>

		<div class="process-title">Interviews</div>
		<div class="panel">
		  	<p>To complement this knowledge, we also sought to better understand the social media platforms that are commonly used nowadays, how usage and behavior might vary from platform to platform, and the features that users like and dislike about each one. We were also curious about how platform features might shape the way users interact with each other while on the app. 
		  	</p>

			<p>
			We interviewed five Instagram users at CMU that vary in their use of image sharing social media platforms. For each user, we asked them about their intentions behind downloading Instagram, their common interactions with other users’ content and within the app in general, the number of accounts they have, and the type of content they post. We repeated these questions for the other social media platforms users frequently used. Finally, users were asked to demonstrate their typical thought process while using Instagram while performing a walkthrough. To wrap up, we asked each user what they believed “authenticity” to mean, either as a standalone word or in the context of social media.
			</p>

			<p>
			These were the final interview takeaways:
			<li>Some users enjoy the curated and high content quality of Instagram</li>
			<li>Users separate accounts on Instagram to cater towards different audiences or show different parts of themselves </li>
			<li>Users see Instagram feeds as diaries for recording and sharing casual accounts as well as more curated moments</li>
			</p>

		<div class="process-title">Wireframes</div>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>After gathering all that insight, we spent a work session translating what we learned into concrete features. We translated this list to a set of screen flows.</p>
			<p>In creating our initial wireframes, we thought carefully about the insights collected from our research. Originally, we had approached the project with a goal of making Instagram more “authentic” and less prone to the homogeneity and calculated nature of posts nowadays. However, the results of our interviews and our struggle to craft a definition of “authenticity” for us to build toward made it clear that “authenticity” meant different things for everyone.</p> 
			<p>A user could be authentic in their passion for curating beautiful, quality posts while another could see unfiltered, candid photos as their ideal of authentic. An endeavor to de-emphasize the over-curation of photos might be against the wishes of our target market, and enacting such a wide cultural change might be infeasible. Thus, we evolved our end goal to focus on fostering an environment where users would feel comfortable expressing their truest selves and posting the content they want to post, whether it’s ultra-curated, completely unfiltered, or somewhere in between.
		  	</p>
		  	<img style="width:100%" src="pics/newstagram/wireframes.png">
		  	<p>
		  	Our initial ideas centered around returning the focus of Instagram to user interests. We introduced the ideas of “circles”, which are user-curated groups of friends. We also created “streams”, allowing users to host multiple themed feeds, all in the same account. Furthermore, we recognized the idea that users might want to show different kinds of content to different friend circles, we made it so that users can designate which circles can see certain streams. We also took away indicators of social currency. Instead of showing amassed numbers for likes and followers, users would still receive notifications but would not be able to see the consolidated numbers. Finally, we revamped Instagram’s Explore page. Users had mentioned that they purposely avoided clicking on certain types of content to avoid seeing similar items pop up on their Explore page. Furthermore, they expressed frustration at the seeming lack of variety and the ineffectiveness of the current algorithm. Our changes made it possible to filter explore queries by geographic location, chronology, and keyword. 
		  	</p>

		<div class="process-title">Usability Testing</div>
		<div class="panel">
			We speed dated our initial wireframes with five users to test for intuitiveness, whether or not they would enjoy using the app or prefer the changes compared to how Instagram is now, and whether or not we achieved our goal of creating a comfortable, accepting environment for users. We also collected suggestions users might have for improvement.

			</div>
			<p>
			The majority of users commented on our automatic tags and explore page with possible improvements. Users enjoyed the use of automatic tags (generated for photos depending on content) because they allowed for facilitated search, which they felt Instagram doesn’t currently provide. However, they were worried that automatic tags would sometimes be incorrect or irrelevant, and suggested manual tag entry as a way to prevent against that. 
			<p>
			Users also commented on the functionality of the explore page. Most of them enjoyed the different filtering methods and thought they were simple and effective. Although they thought it was a large improvement over the current explore page, they suggested combining current functions, like searching by tag and by location, to make the feature more powerful.
