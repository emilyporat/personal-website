			<div class="subheader-2">Context</div>
			<p>
				This project was focused on supporting a food distribution program run by a large government agency. Through this program, eligible participants can pick up supplemental food from grocery-style warehouses or pop-up events. The team was tasked with replacing the legacy inventory management system with a cloud-based web application built on the Salesforce platform and an accompanying iOS mobile app.
			</p>
			<p>
				The beauty of Salesforce is its plug-and-play nature. Sophisticated applications can be built quickly by using the wide range of 'out of the box' components. However, this particular system has many complex requirements, and custom interfaces were required in three major areas: customer data management, inventory management, and point of sale (POS) checkout system.
			</p>
			<p>
				My focus was centered around the checkout process and interface.

			Participating organizations use two different methods for checkout: manual and store concept. At manual locations, program staff step through each food category and enter the units selected manually. In the grocery store model, a customer shops in a warehouse, following an approved grocery list, and a staff member checks them out using a barcode scanner
		</div>

		<div class="body right" style="margin-top: 5%">
		<div class="subheader-2">Efficiency</div>
			Regardless of the  method, checkout is a high pressure situation - staff members are trying to get through each customer's order as quickly as possible
		</div>

		<div class="body right" style="margin-top: 5%">
		<div class="subheader-2">Attention deficit & physical space</div>
			Users have to constantly shift their focus between the physical shopping cart, customer, screen, barcode scanner, etc. Additionally, some stores don't have much, if any counter space, which makes using the mouse very undesirable.
		</div>

		<div class="body right" style="margin-top: 5%">
		<div class="subheader-2">User error</div>
			It's easy to make mistakes in this rapid-fire environment. Users may encounter several possible errors - some people would rather avoid them, while some prefer to cause them and get feedback. The current system uses audio cues (buzz/beep) to indicate errors when checking out.
		</div>

		<div class="body right" style="margin-top: 5%">
		<div class="subheader-2">Tech literacy</div>
			This is an enterprise application - our users will have different levels of computer proficiency. They are used to a function key based navigation legacy system; moving to point & click alone will be jarring.
		</div>

		<div class="body right" style="margin-top: 5%">
		<div class="subheader-2">Connectivity</div>
			Some organizations have unreliable internet access and some have none at all. A primary purpose of the mobile app is to support those groups with an offline mode. This capability brings a host of technical challenges surrounding data syncing and validity.
