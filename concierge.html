				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>Orchard's Concierge program is a <b>renovation service</b> for customers who want to make improvements to their home before selling in order to <b>increase list price</b> and <b>sell faster</b>. Orchard pays for the renovation upfront and customers pay us back once their home sells.
				</p>

				<div class="space"></div>

				<h3>Why invest in Concierge?</h3>
				<p>
					Concierge is important to Orchard's business for two main reasons:
					<ul>
							<li>It drives <b>conversion</b> and sets Orchard apart from its competitors, especially in a buyer's market when selling is tougher.</li>
							<li>Orchard introduced a 35% Concierge program fee in late 2022, which contributes to overall <b>profitability.</b></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Many Concierge workflows were still being done <b>manually</b> in 2022, which resulted in <b>operational inefficiency</b> and <b>financial losses</b> due to human error.</p>
					<!-- <p>It's also a popular program; Concierge attach rates doubled from 20% in 2021 to 40% in 2022.</p> -->

				<h2>The project</h2>

				<h3>Primary users</h3>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Renovation Leads (RLs) are the main user group — they are internal Orchard employees who manage Concierge projects, including scoping out the work to be done, sending contracts to customers, and ensuring the work is completed.</li>
						<li>RLs spend roughly 70% of their time in the field, visiting job sites, and 30% of their time doing computer work.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<div class="space"></div>

				<h3>How were RLs managing Concierge before?</h3>
				<p>Most were using some combination of a free-text box in Salesforce, bespoke personal spreadsheets, and other external tools like Buildertrend. Because Concierge details weren't being tracked programatically, the Concierge Coordinator also had to generate invoices manually using a GSheet template.</p>
				</p>

<!-- 				<div class="space"></div>

				<h3>Field research + shadowing</h3>
				<p>A PM and I traveled to Austin to shadow a Renovation Lead and see what a day in his life looked like. See below for some of the tools he was using:</p>

				<h3>Design process</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Current state audit: Reviewed existing tooling and identified product gaps & irrelevant info.</li>
					<li>Field research: A PM and I traveled to Austin to shadow a Renovation Lead and see what a day in his life looked like.</li>
					<li>Low fi design & user flow testing: Created mockups and tested with RLs to get feedback.</li>
					<li>High-fi design: created new design system components and created a polished finished product.</li>
					<li>Eng review & visual QA: worked with tech lead to identify new components, answer questions, and review flow once built out.</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="space"></div>

				<h3>Project scope</h3>
				<p>We added net-new functionality to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Generate contracts</li>
						<li>Send contract amendments when the projects change</li>
						<li>View contract statuses and a summary of key details</li>
						<li>Generate invoices based on the latest contract</li>
					</ul>
				<p>See the primary contract generation user flow below:</p>

					</div>
				</div>

				<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<p>
					The new & improved Concierge feature launched in Jan 2023 and was received very well. 
					<ul>
						<li>Accuracy — Concierge-related financial escalations <b>decreased 80%</b> in the 3 following quarters post-launch.</li>
						<li>Operational efficiency — 100% of RLs polled post-launch said that the new product enabled them to do their job more <b>efficiently.</b></li>
						<li>Conversion + profitability —  These improvements allowed RLs to focus on providing a <b>great customer experience</b> and spend less time struggling with inadequate tooling.</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="space"></div>

					<p>The Renovation Leads were also <em>very</em> happy with the rollout.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Internal CSAT for Concierge tooling rose from 3.78 to 4.6 (+22%)!</li>
						<li>In a post-launch survey, one RL said: "I have already used it to create my first scope...and it is Awesome! I no longer have to use Excel!!! Great work!"</li>
						<li>Another: "The new ability to redraft and update the concierge agreement is a smashing success! One of the best improvements I have seen in all software platforms we used in the 3+ years I have been here."</li>
					</ul>
