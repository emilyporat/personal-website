		<div class="summary"><div class="subheader2">Context</div>Every IS major takes the Information Systems Consulting Project course during their Junior Spring. Through this course, students design and implement a usable information system for a client. My team worked with The Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh. <p>Located in Greenfield, the Holocaust Center is a multi-purpose hub for education, events, art, and more. Its mission is to inspire engagement with the history of the Holocaust and to connect with it today.</div>
		
		<div class="summary"><div class="subheader2">Team</div>I worked with two other IS juniors: Kenny Cohen and Sean Park. I took on the role of UX Designer and Frontend Engineer, Kenny served as the scrum master and Full Stack Developer, and Sean was the designer of the platformâ€™s structure and core experience as well as a Full Stack Developer</div>

		<div class="summary"><div class="subheader2">Problem Statement</div> 
		The Holocaust Center does not have a lack of programs; rather, they lack a platform to connect these programs and the physical space to carry out these programs. <p>They want students to be able to engage with the material before, during, and after their visit, and they want teachers to be able to explore different perspectives when teach- ing about the Holocaust. Additionally, the Holocaust Center wants to be a resource both for people who visit in-person but also for those who cannot visit.
		<div class="subheader2">Project Vision</div>
		The tool we developed allows users to engage with the stories of the Holocaust through an interactive, online version of Chutz-Pow, the Holocaust Center's very own comic book series. It will tie together all of the resources the Holocaust Center has to offer, providing a cohesive platform for learning and engagement.
